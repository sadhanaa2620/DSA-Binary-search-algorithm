Input Format:
The first line corresponds to size of an array.
The second line corresponds to the elements in the array.
The third input corresponds to element to be searched.
Output Format:
If the searching element present in the array print the number along with the location Eg:" 10 is found at location 6".
otherwise print "Not found".
